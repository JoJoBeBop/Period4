Week 4 - File Upload exercises. 

http://users.metropolia.fi/~jorib/Period4_Public_html/ex4-1/build/

Everything is done in A but I wasn't able to get the B requirements working. Event the media file validator handling proved to be too much. It always shows error no matter what. 

I got the sliders working but actually trying to change the images styles just outputted "undefined".
